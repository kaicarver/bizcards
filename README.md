Business cards using HTML + CSS + JavaScript + chromium + printer

Try the personalizable hackerspace business cards here:

One page produces 16 [A8-size business cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Card#Dimensions).
They're a little smaller than most business cards, 
but the nice thing is you can easily make 16 cards in four or five cuts (if you have the right cutting tool).

There's also an experimental foldable version with space for a motto or whatever:

I further personalize the cards by stamping them with the hackerspace stamp.

Printing works for me on Ubuntu with Chromium on the Taipei Hackerspace HP Photosmart C6300  
I haven't tried other browsers or printers.

The resulting cards are cheap but better than nothing, which in my experience is what people usually have.

The cards are almost entirely unlike these:

Greg also made some Taipei hackerspace business cards using Inkscape and SVG.
But I don't have a link for them.

back story

I wanted to make some quick-and-dirty business cards using Google Docs:

That got annoying and I didn't succeed, so I tried plain old HTML
