Business cards using HTML + CSS + JavaScript + chromium + printer

Try it out here:

One page produces 16 [A8-size business cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Card#Dimensions).
They're a little smaller than most business cards, 
but the nice thing is you can easily make 16 cards in four or five cuts (if you have the right cutting tool).

Printing works for me on Ubuntu with Chromium on the Taipei Hackerspace HP Photosmart C6300  
I haven't tried other browsers or printers.

Greg also made some Taipei hackerspace business cards using Inkscape and SVG.

back story
------

I wanted to make some quick-and-dirty business cards using Google Docs:  
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1td2C-LrQ6pQnNI6tPKDCQrCfRUh7IarOvHzFkHHpJwk/edit

That got annoying and I didn't succeed, so I tried plain old HTML
